    <h1>Feta-Stuffed Hamburgers</h1>
    <p>
      This is a great hamburger for the grill. Feta cheese gives it a rich and
      creamy taste.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>Â½ teaspoon Worcestershire saucer</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, and
        pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls; flatten to
        make thin patties. Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese onto each of four
        of the patties. Top each of the patties with cheese with one of the
        patties without; press the edges together to seal the cheese into the
        center.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired
        degree of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160
        degrees F (70 degrees C).
